========================
Django's tasks framework
========================

For a web application, there's often more than just turning HTTP requests into
HTTP responses. For some functionality, it may be beneficial to run code outside
of the request-response cycle.

That's where background tasks come in.

Background tasks can offload complexity outside of the request-response cycle,
to be run somewhere else, potentially at a later date. This keeps requests fast,
latency down, and improves the user's experience.

Background task fundamentals
============================

When work needs to be done in the background, Django creates a Task, which is
stored in the Queue Store. This task contains all of the metadata needed to
execute the task, as well as a unique identifier for Django to retrieve the
result later.

Outside of Django, a Worker looks at the Queue Store for new Tasks to run. When
a new Task is added, the Worker claims the task, executes it, and saves the
status and result back to the Queue Store.

Configuring a Task backend
==========================

Background tasks require some work to set up.

Different task backends have different characteristics and configuration options,
which may impact the performance and reliability of your application.

Task backends are configured using the :setting:`TASKS` setting in your settings
file.

.. _immediate-task-backend:

Immediate execution
-------------------

This is the default backend if another is not specified in your settings file.
The immediate backend runs enqueued tasks immediately, rather than in the
background. This allows background task functionality to be slowly added
to an application, before the required infrastructure is available.

.. warning::

    When :setting:`ENQUEUE_ON_COMMIT <TASKS-ENQUEUE_ON_COMMIT>` is ``False``,
    the task will be executed within the same transaction it was enqueued in.

    This may lead to unexpected behavior changes when changing backend in future.

To use it, set :setting:`BACKEND <TASKS-BACKEND>` to
``"django.tasks.backends.immediate.ImmediateBackend"``::

    TASKS = {"default": {"BACKEND": "django.tasks.backends.immediate.ImmediateBackend"}}

.. _dummy-task-backend:

Dummy backend
-------------

The dummy backend doesn't execute enqueued tasks at all, instead storing results
for later use.

This backend is not intended for use in production - it is provided as a
convenience that can be used during development and testing.

To use it, set :setting:`BACKEND <TASKS-BACKEND>` to
``"django.tasks.backends.dummy.DummyBackend"``::

    TASKS = {"default": {"BACKEND": "django.tasks.backends.dummy.DummyBackend"}}

The results for enqueued tasks can be retrieved from the backend's
:attr:`results <django.tasks.backends.dummy.DummyBackend.results>` attribute::

    from django.tasks import default_task_backend

    my_task.enqueue()

    assert len(default_task_backend.results) == 1

Stored results can be cleared using the
:meth:`clear <django.tasks.backends.dummy.DummyBackend.clear>` method::

    default_task_backend.clear()

    assert len(default_task_backend.results) == 0

Using a custom backend
----------------------

While Django includes support for a number of task backends out-of-the-box,
sometimes you might want to customize the the task backend. To use an external
task backend with Django, use the Python import path as the
:setting:`BACKEND <TASKS-BACKEND>` of the :setting:`TASKS` setting, like so::

    TASKS = {
        "default": {
            "BACKEND": "path.to.backend",
        }
    }

If you're building your own backend, you can use the standard task backends
as reference implementations. You'll find the code in the
:source:`django/tasks/backends/` directory of the Django source.

Backend arguments
-----------------

Each backend can be given additional arguments to control its behavior.
These arguments are provided as additional keys in the :setting:`TASKS` setting.
Valid arguments are as follows:

* :setting:`ENQUEUE_ON_COMMIT <TASKS-ENQUEUE_ON_COMMIT>`: Whether a task should
  be enqueued at the end of the current transaction (if there
  is one) commits successfully, rather than enqueueing immediately. This argument
  defaults to ``True``.

* :setting:`QUEUES <TASKS-QUEUES>`: Restrict the queue names a task may be
  enqueued to. By default, only the ``"default"`` queue is allowed. Queue name
  validation can be disabled by setting this to an empty list.

Asynchronous support
--------------------

Django has developing support for asynchronous task backends.

``django.tasks.backends.base.BaseTaskBackend`` has async variants of all base
methods. By convention, the asynchronous versions of all methods are prefixed
with ``a``. The arguments for both variants are the same.

Retrieving backends
-------------------

Backends can be retrieved using the ``tasks`` connection handler::

    from django.tasks import tasks

    tasks["default"]  # The default backend
    tasks["reserve"]  # Another backend

The "default" backend is available as ``default_task_backend``::

    from django.tasks import default_task_backend

Backend features
----------------

Django's tasks framework is designed to be backend-agnostic. This means some
backends may not implement the same features as others, such as executing ``async``
functions.

Depending on the backend configured, it may be necessary to gracefully degrade
functionality, or use a system check to prevent the application from starting at all.

To facilitate this, certain features can be checked on a backend:

* :attr:`supports_defer <django.tasks.backends.base.BaseTaskBackend.supports_defer>`:
  Can tasks be executed after a specific time using ``run_after``?

* :attr:`supports_async_task <django.tasks.backends.base.BaseTaskBackend.supports_async_task>`:
  Can ``async`` functions (coroutines) be used as task functions?

* :attr:`supports_get_result <django.tasks.backends.base.BaseTaskBackend.supports_get_result>`:
  Can a task's results be retrieved from another thread or process?

Defining tasks
==============

Tasks are defined using the :meth:`django.tasks.task` decorator on a
module-level function::

    from django.tasks import task


    @task()
    def calculate_meaning_of_life(answer=42):
        return answer

Returned in a :class:`django.tasks.Task` instance.

.. note::

    All arguments and return values must be JSON serializable, and round-trip
    as the same types.

    This means complex types like model instances, as well as many built-in types
    like ``datetime`` and ``tuple`` cannot be used in tasks without additional
    conversion.

The ``task`` decorator accepts a few keyword arguments to customize the task:

* ``priority``: The priority of the task. Higher numbers will be executed sooner.

* ``queue_name``: The name of the queue the task will be executed on

* ``backend``: The name of the backend this task must use (as defined in
  :setting:`TASKS`).

* ``enqueue_on_commit``: Whether the task is enqueued when the current transaction
  commits successfully, or enqueued immediately.

These arguments correspond to attributes on the created
:class:`Task <django.tasks.Task>`.

By convention, tasks should be defined in a ``tasks.py`` file, however this is
not enforced.

Modifying tasks
---------------

Before enqueueing tasks, it may be necessary to modify certain parameters of the task.
For example, to give it a higher priority than it would normally.

A ``Task`` instance cannot be modified directly. Instead, a modified instance
can be created with the :meth:`using <django.tasks.Task.using>` method, leaving
the original as-is::

    calculate_meaning_of_life.priority  # 0

    calculate_meaning_of_life.using(priority=10).priority  # 10

``using`` allows modifying the following attributes:

* :attr:`priority <django.tasks.Task.priority>`
* :attr:`backend <django.tasks.Task.backend>`
* :attr:`queue_name <django.tasks.Task.queue_name>`
* :attr:`run_after <django.tasks.Task.run_after>`

``run_after`` may also be provided as a :class:`timedelta <datetime.timedelta>`,
which is used relative to the current time (when ``using`` is called), or a
timezone-aware :class:`datetime <datetime.datetime>`.

Enqueueing tasks
================

To add the task to the queue store, so it will be executed, call the ``enqueue``
method on it::

    result = calculate_meaning_of_life.enqueue()

Returned is a :class:`django.tasks.TaskResult`, which can be used to retrieve
the result of the task once it has finished executing.

If the task takes arguments, these can be passed as-is to ``enqueue``::

    result = calculate_meaning_of_life.enqueue(answer=42)

To enqueue tasks in an ``async`` context, :meth:`aenqueue <django.tasks.Task.aenqueue>`
is available as an ``async`` variant of ``enqueue``.

Transactions
------------

By default, tasks are enqueued after the current transaction (if there is one)
commits successfully (using :meth:`transaction.on_commit <django.db.transaction.on_commit>`),
rather than enqueueing immediately.

This behavior can be changed by changing the :setting:`TASKS-ENQUEUE_ON_COMMIT`
setting for the backend, or for a specific task using the ``enqueue_on_commit``
parameter.

Task results
============

When enqueueing a ``Task``, you receive a :class:`django.tasks.TaskResult`,
however it's likely useful to retrieve the result from somewhere else (for example
another request or another task).

Each ``TaskResult`` has a unique :attr:`id <django.tasks.TaskResult.id>`, which
can be used to identify and retrieve the result once the code which enqueued the
task has finished.

The :meth:`django.tasks.Task.get_result` method can retrieve a result based on
its ``id``::

    # Later, somewhere else...
    result = calculate_meaning_of_life.get_result(result_id)

If the ``TaskResult`` exists, it is returned. If it doesn't exist, or isn't a
result for ``calculate_meaning_of_life``, :exc:`django.tasks.exceptions.ResultDoesNotExist`
is raised.

To retrieve a ``TaskResult``, regardless of which kind of ``Task`` it was from,
use the ``get_result`` method on the API

To retrieve results in an ``async`` context, :meth:`aget_result <django.tasks.Task.aget_result>`
is available as an ``async`` variant of ``get_result`` on both the backend and ``Task``.

Some backends, such as the built in ``ImmediateBackend`` do not support ``get_result``.
Calling ``get_result`` on these backends will raise :exc:`NotImplementedError`.

Updating results
----------------

A ``TaskResult`` contains the status of a task's execution at the point it was
retrieved. If the task finishes after ``get_result`` is called, it will not update.

To refresh the values, call the :meth:`django.tasks.TaskResult.refresh` method::

    result.status  # RUNNING

    result.refresh()  # or await result.arefresh()

    result.status  # SUCCEEDED

Return values
-------------

If your task function returns something, it can be retrieved from the
:attr:`django.tasks.TaskResult.return_value` attribute::

    result.return_value  # 42

If the task has not finished executing, or has failed, :exc:`ValueError` is raised.

Exceptions
----------

If the task doesn't succeed, and instead raises an exception, either
as part of the task or as part of running it, the exception class is saved
to the :attr:`django.tasks.TaskResult.exception_class` attribute::

    assert result.exception_class == ValueError

Note that this is just the type of exception, and contains no other values.
The traceback information is reduced to a string which you can use to help
debugging::

    print(result.traceback)
